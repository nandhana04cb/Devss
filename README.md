  ### Project Description
e-Kalavara is a platform that simplifies college canteen operations. Students and staff can view menus, pre-book meals with digital tokens, track dues, and submit complaints. It also includes an admin interface to update menus and monitor student dues, ensuring smooth and efficient management.

### The Problem statement
Managing college canteen operations is inefficient and troublesome due to outdated manual processes. Student expenses for unpaid dues are recorded manually in a register, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Late-arriving students often face food shortages, and the rush to collect tokens during peak hours leads to delays and inconvenience.

### The Solution
e-Kalavara is a web-based platform that streamlines college canteen operations by allowing students to view menus in advance, pre-order meals, and track dues digitally. This reduces the reliance on manual record-keeping, minimizes food shortages by managing orders in advance, and eliminates token queues through a pre-booking system. The platform also provides an admin interface to update menus and monitor payments efficiently, improving overall efficiency and user satisfaction.

  ### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
Installing any necessary frontend libraries and dependencies is the initial step in setting up the project. Use CDNs to include JavaScript libraries in your HTML files, or download them as needed. Installing any required libraries with npm install <library> and initializing npm in your project folder with npm init -y are optional for local setups. Open the project folder, then use a local web server or open the HTML file in a browser to start the application. The "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code offers a simple method of serving your files.Alternatively, you can execute python -m http.server in the project folder to utilize Python's built-in HTTP server. After it is finished, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 or the URL your server has supplied to access your platform.
# Run
Open the project folder, then use a local web server or open the HTML file in a browser to start the application. You may serve your files more smoothly by using VS Code's "Live Server" extension. As an alternative, you can use Python to launch a local server by going to the project folder in your terminal and typing python -m http.server. To access your platform, launch a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 (or the appropriate URL your server has provided).
